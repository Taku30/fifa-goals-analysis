# ⚽ FIFA World Cup Goal Analysis

This project explores historical trends in goal scoring during the FIFA World Cup (1930–2018) using R and Quarto. It analyzes scoring patterns across time, tournament stages, team performance, and match attendance.

## 📊 Highlights

- 📈 Average goals per match by year
- 🏟️ Goal distribution in knockout rounds (Quarter-finals, Semi-finals, Final)
- 👥 Attendance vs goals per match
- 🥇 Top-scoring national teams (e.g., Brazil, Germany, Argentina)

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Language**: R
- **Libraries**: tidyverse, ggplot2
- **Reporting**: Quarto (.qmd)
- **Data Source**: Kaggle (linked below)

## 📁 Project Structure

## 📚 Data Source

- [Kaggle – FIFA World Cup Matches (by abecklas)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abecklas/fifa-world-cup)

## 📌 Summary of Findings

- Goal averages dipped in the 1990s but have slightly increased in recent tournaments.
- Finals tend to have fewer goals, likely due to defensive strategies.
- There's no strong linear relationship between attendance and goals, though high-attendance matches often feature top teams.
- Brazil, Germany, and Argentina lead as the most prolific goal-scoring teams in World Cup history.

## 🚀 Future Work

- Include expected goals (xG) if data is available
- Analyze goal timing (first half, second half, extra time)
- Explore correlation between substitutions and late goals
- Build an interactive dashboard or animation
